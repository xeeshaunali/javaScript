Yes, the provided script will work with various versions of Excel files, specifically .xlsx files, which are the most common Excel file format used nowadays. The script uses the pandas library along with openpyxl to read the Excel files. The openpyxl library is capable of handling .xlsx files created by different versions of Microsoft Excel.

However, if you have older Excel files in the .xls format, you will need to use a different engine to read the files. The pandas library can work with the xlrd library to read .xls files.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the script to support both .xlsx and .xls files:

Modified Script to Support Both .xlsx and .xls Files
Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have pandas, openpyxl, and xlrd installed. You can install them using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install pandas openpyxl xlrd
Update the Script:
Modify the script to check the file extension and use the appropriate engine.

Python Script
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import os

def get_sheet_names(excel_file):
    """Get the list of sheet names from the Excel file."""
    if excel_file.endswith('.xlsx'):
        xls = pd.ExcelFile(excel_file, engine='openpyxl')
    elif excel_file.endswith('.xls'):
        xls = pd.ExcelFile(excel_file, engine='xlrd')
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported file format")
    return xls.sheet_names

def excel_to_sql_insert(excel_file, sheet_name, table_name):
    # Read the Excel file
    try:
        if excel_file.endswith('.xlsx'):
            df = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name=sheet_name, engine='openpyxl')
        elif excel_file.endswith('.xls'):
            df = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name=sheet_name, engine='xlrd')
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported file format")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return []
    
    # Set 'id' column to an empty string if it exists
    if 'id' in df.columns:
        df['id'] = ' '
    
    # Generate SQL INSERT statements
    insert_queries = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Get column names and values
        columns = ', '.join(df.columns)
        values = ', '.join([f"'{str(value)}'" if not pd.isna(value) else 'NULL' for value in row])
        
        # Create the INSERT query
        query = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} ({columns}) VALUES ({values});"
        insert_queries.append(query)
    
    return insert_queries

if __name__ == "__main__":
    excel_file = 'your_excel_file.xlsx'  # Replace with your file name
    table_name = 'your_table_name'  # Replace with your table name
    
    # Print available sheet names
    sheet_names = get_sheet_names(excel_file)
    print("Available sheet names:", sheet_names)
    
    # Update this to match one of the available sheet names
    sheet_name = 'Sheet1'  # Replace with the correct sheet name
    
    queries = excel_to_sql_insert(excel_file, sheet_name, table_name)
    
    # Save the queries to a file
    output_file = 'output.sql'
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for query in queries:
            file.write(query + '\n')
    
    print(f"SQL INSERT queries have been saved to {output_file}")
Explanation
Check File Extension:

The script checks the file extension to determine whether to use openpyxl for .xlsx files or xlrd for .xls files.
Raises a ValueError for unsupported file formats.
Read Excel File:

Uses the appropriate engine based on the file extension when reading the Excel file.
Running the Script
Save the Script:

Save the modified script to a file, for example, excel_to_sql.py.
Run the Script:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where your script is located.
Run the script:
sh
Copy code
python excel_to_sql.py
Check the Output File:

After running the script, you will find a file named output.sql in the same directory as the script. This file contains all the generated SQL INSERT queries suitable for phpMyAdmin, with the id field set to an empty string (' ').
Example Adjustment for File Paths
If your files are located in different directories, update the paths accordingly:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    excel_file = 'C:\\path\\to\\your\\excel_file.xlsx'  # Use double backslashes or raw strings
    table_name = 'your_table_name'  # Replace with your table name
    
    # Print available sheet names
    sheet_names = get_sheet_names(excel_file)
    print("Available sheet names:", sheet_names)
    
    # Update this to match one of the available sheet names
    sheet_name = 'Sheet1'  # Replace with the correct sheet name
    
    queries = excel_to_sql_insert(excel_file, sheet_name, table_name)
    
    # Save the queries to a file
    output_file = 'C:\\path\\to\\save\\output.sql'  # Specify the full path to save the output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for query in queries:
            file.write(query + '\n')
    
    print(f"SQL INSERT queries have been saved to {output_file}")
This ensures compatibility with both .xlsx and .xls file formats and proper handling of different Excel file versions.
